  <p class="p">If you are new to coding and web development, simply deciding where to begin can be a daunting task! A
    good place to start is asking yourself which languages you should learn. However, there are so many languages out
    there that it would be prudent to first find out: what interests you? What are your goals? where you do you want to
    work and what type of work could you see yourself doing? To get started on your coding journey, fill out the forms
    below to see exactly where you should begin!
  </p>
  <div>
    <h2 class="p">This form will show what languages you should learn based on certain physical characteristics</h2>
    <form>
      <label for="userAge"> What is your age?: </label>
      <input id="userAge" type="text" name="userAge">
      <label for="hairColor"> What is your hair color?: </label>
      <input id="hairColor" type="text" name="hairColor">
      <label for="height"> What is your height? (short, average, or tall) </label>
      <input id="height" type="text" name="height">
      <button type="submit">Show me the language I should learn!</button>
    </form>
    <br />
    <button type="button" class="hidden" id="reset">Reset</button>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 class="p">This form will determine if you are suited more towards Front End or Back End development</h2>
    <p>Let's say you and a friend were tasked with a project to make a poster about a difficult
      problem that was recently on your physics exam. One person should be in charge of doing the math and finding the
      correct result, and the other would be in charge of displaying all of the information related to the problem and
      the solution to the problem on the poster. Which task would you prefer to take on?</p>
    <form class="radio-form">
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="flavor" value="chocolate" checked>
        Design the poster

      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="flavor" value="vanilla">
        Do the math and find the solution
        <button type="submit">Submit!</button>
