  <p class="p">If you are new to coding and web development, simply deciding where to begin can be a daunting task! A
    good place to start is asking yourself which languages you should learn. However, there are so many languages out
    there that it would be prudent to first find out: what interests you? What are your goals? where you do you want to
    work and what type of work could you see yourself doing? To get started on your coding journey, fill out the form
    below to see exactly where you should begin!
